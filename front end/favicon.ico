# Favicon Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the favicon.ico file.

To add a proper favicon:

1. Create a 16x16, 32x32, or 64x64 pixel icon
2. Save it as favicon.ico
3. Replace this file with your actual favicon

You can use online tools like:
- favicon.io
- realfavicongenerator.net
- favicon-generator.org

For now, the application will work without a favicon, but it's recommended to add one for a professional appearance.
